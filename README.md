IRIS_DATA

Introduction

The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples for each of three species of Iris flower - Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor (pictured below). Each sample is comprised of 4 measurements or features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Our objective is to train a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to determine the species of Iris flower from a set of unknown test samples using the Iris dataset. Let's get started!
